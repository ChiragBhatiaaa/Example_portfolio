# Welcome to My Portfolio Playground!
This repository showcases a dynamic example portfolio website I built using Python and Streamlit, packaged and deployed using Docker and Kubernetes.

Think of it as a playground for creativity and experimentation!

Project Overview:
- Frontend: A custom Streamlit application serves as the interactive portfolio website.
- Backend: Python scripts handle data and logic.
- Deployment: Docker image encapsulates the application for seamless deployment.
- Orchestration: Kubernetes manages containerized applications effectively.

Exploring the Playground:
- streamlit_app.py: This is the heart of the application. You can customize and play around with the code to personalize your portfolio experience.
- requirements.txt: Lists all the necessary Python dependencies.
- Dockerfile: Defines the instructions for building the Docker image.
- manifest.yaml: Configures the deployment of the containerized application in Kubernetes.

How to Play:
- Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python, Streamlit, Docker, and Kubernetes installed and configured.

Running the App Locally:
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
- Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies.
- Start the application using streamlit run streamlit_app.py.
